internally uses decimal degrees

GeoMag functions

main()
	parses command-line arguments
	reads data file
	digests startdate
	gets decimal lat/lon
	calls subroutines
	displays outputs from global variables
	
double julday(month, day, year)
	returns date as decimal fraction of a year
	
int getshc
	returns Schmidt Quasi-Normal Internal Spherical Harmonic Coefficients
	from datafile
	writes to globals gh1 and gh2
	
extrapsh(date, gh1, gh2)
	Extrapolates linearly a spherical harmonic model with rate-of-change model
